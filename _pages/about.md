My name is Ka Young Kim, a Master's student, supervised by Prof. [Seong Tae Kim](https://ami.khu.ac.kr/people/pi/) at Kyung Hee University, South Korea. My research focuses on AI in healthcare, particularly in designing computer vision–based algorithms for understanding and assisting in laparoscopic and robotic surgeries. I am especially interested in enabling AI to understand surgical scenes and interact with humans.
